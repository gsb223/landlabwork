# Landlabwork Repo

Gabriela Birardi Undergrad Research
Advisor: Frank Pazzaglia (EES Department)  

## Description

This is the repository for all of my code ranging from Sprign 2022 to Spring 2023. The code in the beginning is less. Modeling used to model landscape change using the LandLab pthon library. All code is written in Python but there are many files that are jupyter notebooks.

## Installation

To be able to run the files you need to download the developer version of LandLab (https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/install/index.html). Make sure to keep it updated. All of this code was created using the IDE Visual Studio Code but any other IDE should work as well, you just need to make sure that when you run a file it is done in the landlab_dev kernel. (your install could create a different name but if your compiler is unable to identify the component imports then it is likely that you are not running in the correct kernel or the install was messed up). You will also need to have the most updated of Python installed on your computer. All of the code is written in Python but it is located in juptyer notebook files. 

## Folders 
- final_code : this contains the final code used for a fully working model in SPring 2023
- landlab_tutorials : contains codes taken from landlab tutorials and run to xpereiment with the components
- testing_code : contains code to experiment with random features and components, used in Spring and Fall of 2022 experimenting
- Alex_ascii.txt is a ext file ascii file of the DEM of the Alexauken Creek watershed. Exported from ArcGIS. 

## Acknowledgments

I talked with several other eople more familiar with landlab as I was learning how to use it. Charlie Shobe who is currently at West Virginia University was very helpful in understanding the SPACE component which he helped create. Also from Tulane University, Laurent Roberge and Nicole Gasparini were helpful in understanding overland flow , rainfall and combining the components.
