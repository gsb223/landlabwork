# Final Working Code Repository 

Gabriela Birardi Senior Thesis  
Spring 2023  
Advisor: Frank Pazzaglia (EES Department)  

## Description
These files are used to simulate hurricane level storm events. 

## Files 
- hurricane_sim.py : python file version to add to thesis appendix 
- storm_alex : jupyter notebook for storm on alexuaken creek watershed
- storm_sample : jupyter notebook for storm on synthetic topography

The main difference between the files for the alex and sample topos are the node locations and the ascii file being read and imported

## Acknowledgments

I talked with several other eople more familiar with landlab as I was learning how to use it. Charlie Shobe who is currently at West Virginia University was very helpful in understanding the SPACE component which he helped create. Also from Tulane University, Laurent Roberge and Nicole Gasparini were helpful in understanding overland flow , rainfall and combining the components.
