# Image Folders 

Gabriela Birardi Senior Thesis  
Spring 2023  
Advisor: Frank Pazzaglia (EES Department)  

## Description

This folder was a place to save all the images produces in the other code files 

## Folders 

- hydrographs: hydrograph images
- images_for_video : these are the images I compiled into video ( time lapse) I used a free website to compile the images and they are numbered in order
- images_simulations : these are separated in each folder for 'alex' (the alexuaken creek watershed) or "sample" for the synethetic topography. 'base' is for base rainfall and 'increase' is for increasing rainfall. 
- images_standard : holded generatic images like intiial and final topography and the locations for the hydrographs

## Acknowledgments  

I talked with several other people more familiar with landlab as I was learning how to use it. Charlie Shobe who is currently at West Virginia University was very helpful in understanding the SPACE component which he helped create. Also from Tulane University, Laurent Roberge and Nicole Gasparini were helpful in understanding overland flow , rainfall and combining the components.
